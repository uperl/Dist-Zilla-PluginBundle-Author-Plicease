  # ABSTRACT: Upload a dist to CPAN

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 [Author::Plicease::Upload]
 cpan = 1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This works similar to L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN>.  Except:

=over 4

=item Non fatal

It doesn't die if the upload does not succeed.  In my work flow I usually
just upload the tarball manually when the upload fails.  Sometimes I also
want to do the release step when I am not connected to the Internet.

=item Asks first

If C<cpan> is set to a true value, ask first before uploading to CPAN.
Sometimes and for some dists I instead commit it to a GitHub pages website
for internal use.  If C<cpan> is set to a false value or if you deny
uploading to CPAN, the dist will be copied into the usual place where
the aforementioned GitHub pages repository is checked out.

=back

Basically just some personal preferences, you can and probably should
replace this with C<[UploadToCPAN]> if you are taking over a dist.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 cpan

Either C<1> or C<0>.  Set to C<0> and dist will not be uploaded to CPAN
on release.

=head2 url

Base web URL if CPAN upload is disabled.
